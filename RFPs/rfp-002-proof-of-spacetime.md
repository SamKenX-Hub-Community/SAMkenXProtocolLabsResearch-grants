# RFP-002: Novel constructions for *Proof-of-Spacetime*

**Brief description:**
We aim at stimulating the creation of novel constructions for Proof-of-Spacetime, described in the [Filecoin whitepaper](https://filecoin.io/filecoin.pdf), by offering grants to solve any of the open problems listed in the problem statement below.

**Problem Statement:** https://github.com/protocol/research/issues/5.  (read also: https://github.com/protocol/research/issues/4)

**Application Deadline:** 30 May 2018

**Recommended team**
 - From 1 to few cryptography researchers
 - Experience with applied cryptography, including verifiable computation

**Objective:** Address any of Concrete Open Problems (1-5) in the Problem Statement linked
  - Provide a solution (or an impossibility result) in the form of a formal technical paper or an implemented library.
  - Present the work in a formal recorded video presentation.

**Award:** Up to $200,000 (USD) per grant with up to 20% payable in Filecoin

**Payout schedule:** Award winners receive the full disbursement shortly after selection

**Results are to be released as open source under MIT license**
