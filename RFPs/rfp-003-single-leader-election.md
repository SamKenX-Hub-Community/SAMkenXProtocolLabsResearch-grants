# RFP-003: Single secret leader election

**Brief description:**
We aim to improve the original Leader Election protocol described in the [Filecoin whitepaper](https://filecoin.io/filecoin.pdf) by offering grants to ensure that all desired properties are provided by an alternative election mechanism that preserves all desired properties, but also elects exactly one leader per epoch.

**Problem Statement:** https://github.com/protocol/research/issues/3

**Application Deadline:** 30 May 2018

**Recommended team**
 - From 1 to few distributed systems and/or cryptography researchers
 - Experience with applied cryptography and distributed consensus mechanisms


**Objective:** Find a method to elect miners that provides the aforementioned properties of _Fairness_, _Secrecy_, and _Public Verifiability_ while electing exactly **one miner at each epoch**
  - Present the work as a technical paper with security proofs.
  - Present the work in a formal recorded video presentation.


**Award:** Up to $200,000 (USD) per grant with up to 20% payable in Filecoin

**Payout schedule:** Award winners receive the full disbursement shortly after selection

**Results are to be released as open source under MIT license**
